A series of components to connect Ladybug and Gismo to ENVI_MET for urban microclimatic analysis.
Original project's name: lb_envimet

FEATURES:
- Modeling 3D buildings with Grasshopper to generate ENVI_MET model areas;
- Integration with other plugins such as Ladybug, Gismo or web app like cadmapper (https://cadmapper.com/);
- Using EPW file to feed simulation file;
- Generating SIM file.

ENHANCEMENT REQUEST RELEASED:
[2018/01/03]
- Equidistant grid limit from 35 to 999;
- New Surface input for DF Envimet Grid;
- Grid based on surface;

[2019/01/21]:
- Timesteps settings for simulation file;
- Building indoor temperature for simulation file;
- Terrain (early adopter);
- Move building component for terrain;

[2019/01/23]:
- LBC settings for simulation file [REMOVED];

[2019/02/09]:
- Soil init condition for simulation file;

[2019/02/20]:

[2019/02/24]:
- Horizontal overhang;

[2019/03/06]:
- Run simulation directly with Grasshopper;

- Combined grid added (telescope + equidistant) - there is a small issue of visualization (WIP with Envimet);
- Terrain color bug fixed;
- Simplified method of calculation for buiding added;
- "Move building up" component removed, it is not necessary;
- SimpleForcing is mandatory for new Config Intermediate file;
- Config file support simulation more than 24 hours now;
